    <p><strong>Welcome to my Write Up</strong></p>
  </div> -->

  <p>The word cloud shows all the non-stop words from the song &ldquo;Cleanin&rsquo; Out My Closet&rdquo;. I made
    this for a data structures class at Brooklyn College.</p>
  <u>
    <div style="font-size: 18px;">It was generated by:</div>
  </u>
  <ul>
    <li>Ignoring English stop-words (<a href="https://www.ranks.nl/stopwords">https://www.ranks.nl/stopwords</a>)
    </li>
    <li>Finding the most frequent words using an ArrayList</li>
    <li>The code was written in Java</li>
    <li>This word cloud was generated by using the Kumo Library (<a
        href="https://github.com/kennycason/kumo">https://github.com/kennycason/kumo</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I chose to use the ArrayList because when I initially visualized the program&rsquo;s main functionalities, I
    personally thought it to be most intuitive to use them at the time. During my time completing this assignment, I
    scrapped the original Java code in order to rewrite it using a HashMap. I couldn&rsquo;t conceptualize a way to
    get around the maps not being able to store duplicate key values, as there were going to be duplicate words.
    Instead, I rewrote the code again, using an ArrayList. Therefore, the benefit of using an ArrayList as opposed
    to another data structure is: providing a more, personally comprehensible solution, as well as fetching elements
    easier. (As in an ArrayList, to get a value, you would need to provide its index. In a HashMap, elements are
    fetched by their corresponding key value).</p>
  <p>Among all other data visualization techniques, I personally preferred the Kumo library, as it displays the words
    in a beautiful way with vibrant colors, is easy to implement, and gave me the least amount of issues when
    testing. Additionally I used the &ldquo;Java dataframe and visualization library&rdquo;, Tablesaw, to visually
    represent the data processed by my code.</p>
  <p><em>The output under the word cloud is a list of all of the English non-stop words in the song. The number is the
      word&rsquo;s frequency, (followed by a colon, followed by a space,) followed by the word itself. At the end
      of the list, the total number of non-stop words in the song is displayed.</em></p>
  <p>If I had more time to work on this project, I would add a database to contain the java code. From the research
    that I have done pertaining to the idea, it could be possible to compile and run the java code when the user
    tries to generate a word cloud from the website.</p>
  <u>
    <div style="font-size: 18px;">The end result would have:</div>
  </u>
  <ul>
    <li>a digestible user interface where the user can use a tool to copy and paste lyrics from any source to create
      the lyrics.txt file</li>
    <li>a text field and button in which the user can enter their own song title/artist and display it</li>
    <li>a database that automatically generates the word cloud from the user inputted text, and outputs the word
      frequencies</li>
    <li>a way for the user to share their results (The title, word cloud, and output as a webpage link)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I selected this song because the artist, Eminem, typically has a large amount and variety or words in his music.
    The song reached number 4 on the United States Billboard Top 100 chart at the time of its release in 2002. The
    top words found were &ldquo;never&rdquo; with a frequency of 15 and &ldquo;meant&rdquo; with a frequency of 12.
    This is not a surprise, as I can recall multiple parts of the song in which Eminem says: &ldquo;I never meant to
    hurt you&rdquo;.</p>
